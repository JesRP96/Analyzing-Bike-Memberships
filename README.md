# Google_DataAnalytics
Repository for Google's Data Analytics project
Hello everyone!

This is my capstone project (Case Study) for Google's Data Analytics Certificate Program by Coursera.

You will find two files including:
  1. Portfolio Deliverable PDF (The Data Analysis Process - ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act)
  2. SQL Query for data analysis

Please find the Tableau's Dashboard here: [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jesus.ponce/viz/GoogleCaseStudy-BikeCase/MembershipTrends "Google Case Study - Bike Case")

Feel free to message me if you want to ask any question or to compliment!
